Hi Alice,

After reviewing the information, it appears that your domain 'site.recruitment.shq.nz' does not have any DNS records associated with it, which is likely the cause of the issue you're facing. Without the correct DNS records, your site cannot be accessed.

I recommend you verify the DNS configuration with your DNS provider or server administrator to ensure that the appropriate records (such as A, CNAME, or NS records) are correctly set up.  Once the DNS records are in place, the site should become accessible again.

If you need any further assistance, feel free to let us know!

Best regards,
Jerry Li
